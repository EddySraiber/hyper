# üìä BASELINE VS REALISTIC BACKTESTING COMPARISON

**Current Idealized Test Assumptions vs Real-World Trading Requirements**

**Date**: August 14, 2025  
**Status**: Task 1 Complete  
**Next Task**: Task 2 - Real-World Friction Cost Research  
**Resume File**: `REAL_WORLD_FRICTION_COSTS.md`

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Our current "bulletproof" backtesting results (23,847% return, 10.71 Sharpe ratio) assume **perfect trading conditions** with zero friction costs. This analysis documents all idealized assumptions and quantifies the gap between backtested performance and real-world trading reality.

**Key Finding**: Current results represent the **theoretical maximum** performance. Real-world performance will be significantly lower due to friction costs, execution delays, and regulatory constraints.

#### Current Assumption:
- **All trades execute for free** (0% commission)
- No per-trade fees, per-share fees, or regulatory costs
- Unlimited trading without cost accumulation

#### Real-World Reality:
- **Stock Commissions**: $0-$5 per trade + regulatory fees
- **Crypto Commissions**: 0.1%-0.5% per trade (both sides)
- **Options Commissions**: $0.65+ per contract
- **Regulatory Fees**: SEC fees (0.00278%), TAF fees, exchange fees

#### **Performance Impact Estimate**: 
- **High-frequency**: -0.5% to -2% per trade
- **Medium-frequency**: -0.2% to -0.8% per trade
- **Low-frequency**: -0.1% to -0.3% per trade

---

### 2. ‚ö° **INSTANT EXECUTION**

#### Current Assumption:
- **Orders execute immediately** at exact desired prices
- No processing delays or queue waiting
- Perfect timing on all entry and exit points

#### Real-World Reality:
- **Network Latency**: 1-50ms geographic delays
- **Broker Processing**: 100-500ms order validation and routing
- **Market Maker Response**: 50-200ms liquidity provider processing
- **Queue Position**: Variable based on price priority and timing

#### **Performance Impact Estimate**:
- **Lightning Lane (<5s)**: May become impossible
- **Express Lane (<15s)**: Degraded to 1-3 second actual execution
- **Price Deterioration**: 0.05%-0.2% due to delays
- **Missed Opportunities**: 10%-20% of signals may be too slow

---

### 3. üìà **ZERO SLIPPAGE**

#### Current Assumption:
- **Perfect price execution** at desired levels
- No bid-ask spread costs
- Unlimited liquidity at all price points

#### Real-World Reality:
- **Bid-Ask Spreads**: 0.01%-0.5% depending on liquidity
- **Market Impact**: Price moves against large orders
- **Temporary Impact**: Short-term price pressure (0.1%-0.3%)
- **Permanent Impact**: Long-term price change (0.05%-0.15%)

#### **Performance Impact Estimate**:
- **Small Orders** (<$10K): -0.05% to -0.1% per trade
- **Medium Orders** ($10K-$100K): -0.1% to -0.3% per trade  
- **Large Orders** (>$100K): -0.3% to -1.0% per trade

---

### 4. üèõÔ∏è **NO TAX IMPLICATIONS**

- **Wash Sale Rules**: Cannot claim losses on repurchases within 30 days
- **State Taxes**: Additional 0%-13.3% in many states

#### **Performance Impact Estimate**:
- **Day Trading Strategy**: -25% to -40% of gains to taxes
- **Swing Trading Strategy**: -20% to -35% of gains to taxes
- **Long-Term Strategy**: -0% to -23.8% of gains to taxes
- **Wash Sale Impact**: 5%-15% additional loss deferral

---

### 5. üíß **PERFECT LIQUIDITY**

#### Current Assumption:
- **Unlimited position sizes** without market impact
- All symbols equally liquid at all times
- No volume or market depth constraints

#### Real-World Reality:
- **Volume Limits**: Cannot exceed 10%-20% of daily volume
- **Market Depth**: Order book limitations at each price level
- **Symbol Liquidity**: Wide variation between major/minor symbols
- **Time-of-Day Effects**: Lower liquidity during off-hours

#### **Performance Impact Estimate**:
- **Major Symbols** (AAPL, TSLA): Minimal impact for reasonable sizes

#### Real-World Reality:
- **Stock Market Hours**: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET (weekdays only)
- **Extended Hours**: Limited liquidity, wider spreads
- **Weekend Gaps**: No stock trading Friday 4PM - Monday 9:30AM
- **Holiday Closures**: Multiple market holidays per year

#### **Performance Impact Estimate**:
- **Gap Risk**: Weekend/holiday price gaps (1%-5% potential)
- **After-Hours Trading**: Reduced liquidity, wider spreads
- **Missed Signals**: 20%-30% of signals may occur during closed hours
- **Crypto Advantage**: True 24/7 trading maintained

---

### 7. ‚öñÔ∏è **NO REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS**

#### Current Assumption:
- **Unlimited trading frequency** without restrictions
- No minimum account balances
- No position or leverage limits

#### Real-World Reality:
- **Pattern Day Trading Rule**: <$25K accounts limited to 3 day trades per 5 days
- **Margin Requirements**: 25%-50% maintenance margins
- **Position Limits**: Exchange-imposed limits on large positions
- **Good Faith Violations**: Cash account settlement delays

#### **Performance Impact Estimate**:
- **Small Accounts** (<$25K): Severely limited trading frequency
- **Medium Accounts** ($25K-$100K): Some constraints on leverage
- **Large Accounts** (>$100K): Minimal regulatory impact
- **Crypto Trading**: Generally fewer restrictions
