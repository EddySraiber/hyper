## 🎯 Statistical Methodology

### Hypothesis Testing

**Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: Enhanced system performance ≤ Baseline system performance
**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: Enhanced system performance > Baseline system performance

**Significance Level**: α = 0.05 (95% confidence)
**Statistical Power**: β = 0.80 (80% power)

### Sample Size Calculation

Minimum sample size calculated using Cohen's formula:
```
n = ((z_α + z_β)² × p × (1-p)) / δ²
```

Where:
- z_α = Critical value for significance level
- z_β = Critical value for statistical power  
- p = Expected proportion (win rate)
- δ = Effect size (minimum detectable difference)

### Effect Size Interpretation

**Cohen's d values**:
- 0.2 = Small effect
- 0.5 = Medium effect
- 0.8 = Large effect

### Confidence Intervals

All performance metrics include confidence intervals calculated using:
- **Returns**: Bootstrap sampling with 1000 iterations
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Jobson-Korkie method with asymptotic standard errors
- **Win Rate**: Wilson score interval for proportion confidence

## 🧮 Mathematical Foundations

### Signal Synergy Calculation

The synergy score quantifies how much the combined system outperforms the sum of its parts:

```
Synergy Score = Combined_Accuracy - Mean(Individual_Accuracies)
```

### Risk-Adjusted Performance

**Sharpe Ratio**:
```
Sharpe = (R_p - R_f) / σ_p
```
Where:
- R_p = Portfolio return
- R_f = Risk-free rate
- σ_p = Portfolio volatility

**Information Ratio**:
```
Information Ratio = (R_p - R_b) / TE
```
Where:
- R_b = Benchmark return
- TE = Tracking error

### Monte Carlo Confidence Intervals

For return distribution R with n simulations:
```
CI_α = [Percentile(R, α/2), Percentile(R, 1-α/2)]
```

### Signal Attribution Analysis

Performance attribution using factor regression:
```
R_t = α + β₁×News_t + β₂×Regime_t + β₃×Options_t + ε_t
```

Where βᵢ coefficients represent each signal's contribution.

## ⚠️ Important Limitations

### Data Considerations

1. **Historical Performance**: Past results don't guarantee future performance
2. **Market Regime Changes**: Model may not adapt to unprecedented conditions
3. **Sample Size**: Limited historical data for some market conditions
4. **Survivorship Bias**: Analysis may not account for failed strategies

### Statistical Limitations

1. **Multiple Testing**: Increased Type I error risk with many simultaneous tests
2. **Model Assumptions**: Normality assumptions may not hold for all metrics
3. **Parameter Optimization**: Risk of overfitting to historical data
4. **Regime Stability**: Market regimes may change in ways not captured by models

### Implementation Risks

1. **Execution Differences**: Live trading may differ from backtesting
2. **Market Impact**: Large positions may affect market prices
3. **Technology Risk**: System failures or connectivity issues
4. **Regulatory Changes**: New regulations may affect strategy viability
