├── Database (logs.db): 107MB (319,686 entries)
├── Application logs: 51MB (unrotated)
├── Application code: 2MB
└── Cache/temp: 1MB
```

### After Optimization
```
Total Storage: ~110-120MB (25-30% reduction)
├── Database (logs.db): ~60MB (optimized, 7-day retention)
├── Application logs: 51MB (rotation framework active)
├── Application code: 2MB
└── Cache/temp: 0MB (automated cleanup)
```

### Ongoing Optimization
```
Steady-State Storage: 70-80MB
├── Database: 15-20MB (7-day rolling retention)
├── Application logs: 10-15MB (daily rotation + compression)
├── Application code: 2MB

## 🛠️ Implemented Components

### 1. Database Retention System
```python
# Automatic 7-day retention policy
DELETE FROM logs WHERE timestamp < datetime('now', '-7 days');
VACUUM;  # Database optimization
```

### 2. Log Rotation Configuration
```bash
# Daily rotation with compression
/app/logs/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 7
    compress
    delaycompress
    copytruncate
}
```

### 3. Automation Scripts
- **Daily cleanup**: Removes old logs and optimizes database
- **Weekly cache cleanup**: Python bytecode cache removal
- **Docker daemon**: Containerized continuous cleanup

## 🔧 Activation Instructions

### Immediate Activation (Docker Environment)
```bash
# Start automated cleanup daemon
python3 scripts/docker_cleanup.py --daemon &

# Manual database cleanup (already executed)
python3 scripts/cleanup_database.py
```

### Traditional Server Setup
```bash
# Install logrotate configuration
sudo cp logrotate.conf /etc/logrotate.d/algotrading

# Add daily cleanup to cron
echo "0 2 * * * /home/eddy/Hyper/scripts/daily_cleanup.sh" | crontab -

# Test logrotate
logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.d/algotrading
```

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Monitor storage usage
du -sh data/ logs/

# Check database size
ls -lh data/logs.db

# Monitor cleanup execution
tail -f logs/algotrading.log | grep "cleanup"
```
