# üéØ REALISTIC BACKTESTING MASTER PLAN

**Comprehensive Real-World Validation with Friction Costs**

**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Current Session**: Initial Planning  
**Next Session Resume Point**: Task 1 - Baseline Documentation  
**Date**: August 14, 2025

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The current backtesting suite provides **idealized results** (23,847% return, 10.71 Sharpe) assuming perfect execution with zero friction costs. While excellent as a baseline, we must validate performance under **realistic trading conditions** with:

- **Commission costs** (per-trade and per-share fees)
- **Tax implications** (short-term capital gains, wash sale rules)
- **Execution delays** (realistic order processing times)
- **Market impact** (slippage, bid-ask spreads)
- **Regulatory constraints** (pattern day trading, margin requirements)

**Goal**: Create a production-ready backtesting framework that accurately predicts real-world performance.
